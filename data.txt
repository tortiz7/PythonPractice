I'm screaming
Help me
Do I have it?
I don't know
I hope so
But won't know
Until I do it!
And if it's hard
or I fail
It's Ok;
There will be another
This is how we learn
We can't learn
If we're perfect
The first go
You have to
make mistakes
Fall
On your face
Get up
Dust off
And persevere
Otherwise
How will they know
You're here?
